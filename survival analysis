#In the doc, we tried to use new tools to be enlarge our skill pool.#

####Load packages
#Instead of library function,we use p_load from pacman.
```{r cars}
#install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)
p_load(ggplot2,rio,dplyr)
```

####import dataset
#use rio rather than setwd/import/export
```{r cars}
# import linelist
linelist_case_data <- rio::import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

```{r cars}
#create a new data called linelist_surv from the linelist_case_data

linelist_surv <-  linelist_case_data %>% 
     
  dplyr::filter(
       # remove observations with wrong or missing dates of onset or date of outcome
       date_outcome > date_onset) %>% 
  
  dplyr::mutate(
       # create the event var which is 1 if the patient died and 0 if he was right censored
       event = ifelse(is.na(outcome) | outcome == "Recover", 0, 1), 
    
       # create the var on the follow-up time in days
       futime = as.double(date_outcome - date_onset), 
    
       # create a new age category variable with only 3 strata levels
       age_cat_small = dplyr::case_when( 
            age_years < 5  ~ "0-4",
            age_years >= 5 & age_years < 20 ~ "5-19",
            age_years >= 20   ~ "20+"),
       
       # previous step created age_cat_small var as character.
       # now convert it to factor and specify the levels.
       # Note that the NA values remain NA's and are not put in a level "unknown" for example,
       # since in the next analyses they have to be removed.
       age_cat_small = fct_relevel(age_cat_small, "0-4", "5-19", "20+")
       )
```


```{r cars}
summary(linelist_surv$futime)
```

```{r cars}
# cross tabulate the new event var and the outcome var from which it was created
# to make sure the code did what it was intended to
linelist_surv %>% 
  tabyl(outcome, event)
```

```{r cars}
linelist_surv %>% 
  tabyl(age_cat_small, age_cat)
```

```{r cars}
linelist_surv %>% 
  select(case_id, age_cat_small, date_onset, date_outcome, outcome, event, futime) %>% 
  head(10)
```

```{r cars}
linelist_surv %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_cat_small, show_na = F) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = "both") %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")
```
